These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the install-elk.yml and filebeat-playbook.yml files may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat and Metricbeat
